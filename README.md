# Congressional Spending on Technology & Digital Media

How much does the United States Congress spend on technology and digital media?  It's a hard question to answer right now, but a necessary one for those who want a 21st Century Congress that works as efficiently, effectively and accountably as possible.  Here you will find spreadsheets containing our underlying data, work and analysis.
